## Introduction

Task 1 of this repository provides you with an essential introduction to the Metasploit Framework. It explains the significance of Metasploit in penetration testing, introduces its two main versions (Metasploit Pro and Metasploit Framework), and highlights its versatility in supporting various phases of a penetration testing engagement.

## Main Components of Metasploit

In Task 2, we delve deeper into the main components of Metasploit. It discusses the critical elements of the framework, including `msfconsole` (the main command-line interface), modules (exploits, scanners, payloads, etc.), and stand-alone tools like `msfvenom`, `pattern_create`, and `pattern_offset`.

## Using msfconsole

Task 3 focuses on using `msfconsole`, the heart of Metasploit. You'll learn how to navigate the command-line interface and perform essential tasks like finding relevant exploits, setting parameters, and exploiting vulnerable services on target systems.

## Working with Modules

Task 4 provides insights into working with Metasploit modules. It covers how to leverage different types of modules, such as exploits and scanners, to conduct penetration testing effectively.

## Summary

Task 5 summarizes the key takeaways from the Metasploit tasks, ensuring you have a solid foundation in using this powerful framework for penetration testing, vulnerability research, and exploit development.
